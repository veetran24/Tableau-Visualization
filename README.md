Story 1 is a dashboard for quick overview of the distribution of listings and the popularity of neighborhoods. The interaction between the map and histogram allows users to explore the data in a more dynamic and engaging way to see number of hosts, listing and average price for specific neighborhood.

Story 2 is provides insights into the distribution of price ranges by neighborhood and room type. The linked histograms offer a detailed view of the number of room types and median prices, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of color coding for price range in the map.

Story 3 is a map allows users to visually compare median prices across different neighborhoods with a text note highlights for the top neighborhoods with high listings and price for Seattle Airbnb market.

Story 4 is the histograms of the top 5 hosts and median prices offer insights into the key contributors to the Airbnb landscape in Seattle. Annotations provide additional context for the top 5 listings and their significance.

## Design choices are are bar chart and map:
- Bar charts effectively convey the distribution and count of listing, host, room types, and median prices for neighborhoods. Labels on each bar ensure that users can quickly identify and compare the information.
- Maps are label with neighborhood name and use color scheme green-blue to  to represent price ranges in different neighborhoods. Darker colors for higher prices and lighter cool colors for lower prices.
- I tried to maintain a consistent color scheme, font, and overall theme throughout the story for visual coherence as green-blue since Seattle is Emerald city.
- The combination of a map and histogram encourages users to interact with the data actively. Clicking on neighborhoods allows users to explore detailed statistics, enhancing their understanding of the distribution and popularity of listings as well as other information of data.
